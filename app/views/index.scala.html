    <h1>About Chess</h1>

    <p>
        Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard
        with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid.[1] The game is played by millions of people worldwide.
        Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga some time before the 7th century.
        Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi, janggi, and shogi.
        Chess reached Europe by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The pieces
        assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century with the introduction of
        "Mad Queen Chess"; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.

        Play does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen,
        two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently,
        with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate[note 1]
        the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces
        are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other. During the game, play
        typically involves making exchanges of one piece for an opponent's similar piece, but also finding and
        engineering opportunities to trade advantageously, or to get a better position. In addition to checkmate,
        a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or (in a timed game) runs out of time. There are also
        several ways that a game can end in a draw.

    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <h3>How to Move the King</h3>

    <p>
        The king is the most important piece, but is one of the weakest. The king can only move one square in any
        direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The king may never move himself into check (where he
        could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".
    </p>

    <h3>How to Move the Queen</h3>

    <p>
        The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward,
        sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.
        And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over. Notice how the
        white queen captures the black queen and then the black king is forced to move.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Move the Rook</h3>

    <p>
        The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides. The rooks are
        particularly powerful pieces when they are protecting each other and working together!
    </p>

    <h3>How to Move the Bishop</h3>

    <p>
        The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color
        (light or dark) and must always stay on that color. Bishops work well together because they cover
        up each other's weaknesses.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Move the Knight</h3>

    <p>
        Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in one direction,
        and then one more move at a 90 degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”. Knights are also the
        only pieces that can move over other pieces.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Move the Pawn</h3>

    <p>
        Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward, but capture
        diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where
        they can move forward two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them.
        They can never move or capture backwards. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he
        cannot move past or capture that piece.
